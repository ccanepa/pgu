- This is a full style, that is it covers all stock widgets.
- All the files referenced in style.ini are present.
- They are some image files not referenced in the style.ini, 
    box.down.png
    box.normal.png
    console.input.focus.png
    console.input.normal.png
    console.png
- All the keys in this theme style.ini are also in the default theme,
  but there's a number of keys in default not present here.
  As a consequence, no blur (hover) effect is rendered, nor 'down' (clicked)
  Unsure if this is a design decision or a work unfinished.
- Being based on gray colors, and with not blur, an user may have
  problem to distinguish between a disabled widget and a normal widget.
