- This is a full style, that is it covers all stock widgets.

- All the files referenced in style.ini are present.

- They are some image files not referenced in the style.ini, 
    box.down.png
    box.normal.png
    console.input.focus.png
    console.input.normal.png
    console.png
    menu.option.normal.png

- Comparing the style.ini with the one from 'default', they are some
  missing keys and some new keys. Missing keys, be it intentional or not,
  make this style not react to blur (hover)

- Being based on gray colors, and with not blur, an user may have
  problem to distinguish between a disabled widget and a normal widget.
